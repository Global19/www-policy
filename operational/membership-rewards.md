# Leadership Rewards Program

The Leadership Awards program is open to all OWASP Leaders, including non-members. The objective of this program is that active leaders who achieve our mission deserve and should be rewarded with full membership for their volunteering, time, and effort. 

If you are already a paid or lifetime member and don't wish to have complimentary membership, you will be bumped up one tier of the Membership Rewards program, to a maximum of 500 points per year (i.e. the maximum Gold membership tier), to obtain additional rewards. This is a huge bonus for those on the cusp of Gold membership or wanting to be recognized over a 5 year period. 

## Mission Related Targets

Each activity earns a number of points towards  Leadership Rewards, and once the Leader has earnt more than 100 Leader Points, they are eligible for complimentary full membership. There are many ways to achieve this number of points and we encourage overachieving for the benefit of our wider community and our members.
