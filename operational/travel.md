### Travel

Good business judgment is always expected when determining the need to travel on behalf of the Foundation where reimbursement is expected. The OWASP Foundation will reimburse travel expenses incurred on behalf of the Foundation for:
- Board members when traveling to Board Meetings and OWASP Global AppSec conferences
- Keynote speakers for approved OWASP conference at their respective speaking opportunity
- Guest speakers, when pre-approved by the Executive Director
- Staff on general business for the Foundation

Travel which is explicitly not reimbursable includes leaders or members attending OWASP Conferences unless as a keynote speaker or in an official capacity as a Director of the Foundation.

Travel expenses include but are not limited to economy airfare, or premium economy if the flight is greater than seven hours, ground transportation, parking, food & beverage, lodging, and other daily business-related expenses. Travel bookings, whenever possible, should be made no later than 21 days prior to departure to reduce costs.

In cases where lodging is pre-arranged and direct billed by the Foundation as part of a room block, reimbursement requests for alternative lodging will be denied. Travel benefits are not transferable.
