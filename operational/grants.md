## Grants Policy

The Grants policy is designed to allow any OWASP Member, Chapter, Project, Committee or OWASP Leader to submit a grant proposal to achieve a specific, measurable, assignable (i.e. we know who will be doing the activity), realistic, and time-bounded (SMART) mission activity. 

Our mission as a not-for-profit requires OWASP to demonstrate not only spending on mission, but outcomes. The Grants policy establishes the mechanisms to ensure that grants are transparent, accountable, and have documented outcomes or deliverables. As grants are for our mission, a grant can be for anything above a normal expense to various limits imposed by this policy. 

## Grants Committee

A Grants Committee shall be established under the standard Committees 2.0 process. This is to ensure that Grants are aligned with OWASP Community expectations, managed by leaders of the OWASP Community, to achieve our mission. 

As operational contracts, signing, and spending are controlled by the Signature policy, the OWASP Executive Director shall Chair this committee, but only vote to break a tie after all Committee leaders have voted. 

### Establishment 

The OWASP Board will initially establish the grant fund with a seed equivalent to the budgeted OWASP Chapter + Project budget, minus any already spent funds for that budget year. This will have the effect of releasing all unrestricted project and chapter balances. 

The Foundation will call for a Grants Committee to be 

## Permitted uses 

Other than the measurable outcome or deliverable specified in a successful grant proposal, grant proposals have no restrictions for what a grant can be spent on other than:

* Normal expenses, which should be reimbursed under the expense policy
* Travel expenses, which should be compliant and reimbursed under the travel policy

The objective is spending on mission to achieve specific outcomes, so the Grants Committee should consider and be able to justify if a reasonable person would understand the requested activity or deliverable achieves our mission. Speculative grants or larger grants (of over $10,000) that have some reasonable chance of failing to deliver on time or at all (such as research), should have milestone payments rather than a single payment. 

## Block Grants and draw down

A large ongoing grant on the same topic may submit a single request per year with a budget and proposed monthly or milestone spend so that financial controls can be applied. This is to ensure to reduce the workload of grant writers and the Grants Committee. The Grants Committee should consider if all large grants should be established with this in mind to protect the Foundation and ensure that cash flow is not harmed.
