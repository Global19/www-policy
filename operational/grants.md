## Grants Policy

The Grants policy is designed to allow any OWASP Member, Chapter, Project, Committee, Event or OWASP Leader to submit a grant proposal to achieve a specific, measurable, assignable (i.e. we know who will be doing the activity), realistic, and time-bounded (SMART) mission activity. 

Our mission as a not-for-profit requires OWASP to demonstrate not only spending on mission, but outcomes. The Grants policy establishes the mechanisms to ensure that grants are transparent, accountable, and have documented outcomes or deliverables. As grants are for our mission, a grant can be for anything above a normal expense to various limits imposed by this policy. 

## Grants Committee

A Grants Committee shall be established under the standard Committees 2.0 process. This is to ensure that Grants are aligned with OWASP Community expectations, managed by leaders of the OWASP Community, to achieve our mission. 

As operational contracts, signing, and spending are controlled by the Signature policy, the OWASP Executive Director shall Chair this committee, but only vote to break a tie after all Committee leaders have voted to ensure that the Committee is seen as representative of the OWASP Community. 

### Establishment, Term Limits, and Elections

The Foundation will call for a Grants Committee to be established, with a leadership number of 4 OWASP Members, preferably drawn from Projects and Chapters with a large balances to reflect the hard work that these Chapters and Projects have done to establish these balances. The first term of the Committee run from founding until December 31, 2021. Once established, this paragraph will have no further effect. 

Anti-fraud leading practices and regulatory controls in many countries and in many industries require rotation of financial officers to prevent fraud (such as taking leave or limited terms). The Grants Committee leadership term is two years, and run from January 1 through December 31 the following year. Grants Committee Leadership will be elected alongside the OWASP Board of Directors election. Term limits that apply to Directors apply to Grants Committee Leadership positions. 

## Finances

### Seed Funding

The OWASP Board will initially establish the expense budget and grant budgets drawing from the project + chapter balances, granting a financially responsible grant drawing down on the overall project + chapter balance. 

This will have the effect of releasing all unrestricted project and chapter balances. 

### Ongoing Funding Until Balances are Spent

Each year, the Board will allocate the Grants Committee a budget for 12 months by January 1 each year. The grants and expenses budget will be funded from the old project + chapter balances until exhausted. Once balances are exhausted, this section will be invalid and no longer used. 

Ongoing funding sources will come from Foundation funds, membership, donations, fundraising, sponsorships, event income, project income, and splits from training, project summits, and regional conferences.

### Ongoing funding after Balances are spent

Funding will be determined and topped up annually by the Board, so that the Grants Committee has access to funds from January 1 each year. 

Ongoing funding sources will come from Foundation funds, membership, donations, fundraising, sponsorships, event income, project income, and splits from training, project summits, and regional conferences. 

### Treatment of splits

Any splits between a project, chapter, committee and the Foundation shall be placed in the Expenses and Grants Pool using this basis: 

* Splits will be evenly divided between the Expenses Pool and the Grants Pool until the Expenses pool has reached 100% of its annual budget set by the Board; 
* After that, 100% of all splits are added to the Grants Pool. 

## Permitted uses 

Spending on mission is required, with demonstrable and timely outcomes. To encourage big ideas, grant proposals have few restrictions for what a grant can be spent on other than:

* Normal expenses are governed by and reimbursed under the expense policy
* Travel expenses are governed by and reimbursed under the travel policy
* Capital expenses are governed by the section below on capital expenses. Unless essential to the success of the proposal, capital expenses should be discouraged, brought within expense policy limits, or not approved
* Scholarships and Awards are governed by the Scholarship and Awards policy, but pre-funded by this policy using the normal grant process
* Events are governed by the Events policy, and cannot be funded under the Grants policy other than scholarships and awards
* Partnership expenses are governed by and reimbursed under the partnership policy

* There are restrictions on grants paying for services that the OWASP Foundation already provides. See below for more details. Grants containing a budget item for Zoom, GitHub, Azure, AWS, etc, should be modified to require re-using OWASP infrastructure. Grants can be used to help pay for the Foundation's costs (if any) to provide dedicated instances or rooms, or whatever. This is because the Foundation has either free or vastly cost reduced access, and we need grants to stretch the grant pool as far as possible. 

* Payments for OWASP memberships is explicitly not permitted for election integrity reasons
* Payments to other organizations require Board approval if the Grants Committee approves the grant proposal

The objective is spending on mission to achieve specific outcomes, so the Grants Committee should consider and be able to justify if a reasonable person would understand the requested activity or deliverable achieves our mission. 

Speculative grants or larger grants (of over $10,000) that have some reasonable chance of failing to deliver on time or at all (such as research), should have milestone payments rather than a single payment. Grants with large upfront payments with no requirements for demonstated progress or deliverables should be rejected to protect the Foundation. 

## Large or Block Single Year Grants

Large or Block Grants are defined as over $10,000 USD, and/or those that have a duration of three months, and/or require multiple payment milestones. 

Grantees may submit a single request per year with a budget, and a proposed conditional monthly or milestone spend. 

* Block grants shall have a budget as part of the grant itself
* The budget will detail the number of milestone, monthly or quarterly periodic payments, as well as the ongoing and total spend
* The grant will document measurable outcomes that apply to milestones or periodic payments. If these conditions cannot be easily and positively demonstrated or measured, the Grant proposal should be rejected. Some examples, "Pay me when people are 10% happier" (immeasurable) or "Pay me when there are no breaches" (invalid proof of the negative) should be rejected
* Draw down is only permitted to the budget in the grant proposal with a monthly or quarterly spend limit
* Large initial or upfront draw down requests should not be approved.
The Grants Committee are responsible for ensuring milestone conditions or final deliverables are delivered or met before issuing payments. 

The goal of this section is to reduce the workload of Grantees and the Grants Committee, protect the Foundation and grant funds for our mission, and ensure that partial milestones and outcomes are verified before payment. 

## Required use of OWASP Infrastructure

Proposed and successful grants must create a webpage under the Grants Committee detailing their proposal, budget, and outcomes, linking to activity that can be monitored by Foundation automation, such as OWASP's GitHub (if a project or similar), Meetup, Slack, YouTube, Zoom, etc, to help the Grants Committee perform their duties in evaluating if a milestone or deliverable has been achieved. This is to provide transparency to competing grantees and our membership, and ensure that the Committee can hold the grantee to their budget and deliverables. Additionally, it assists the Foundation in demonstrating to tax agencies and donors that we are spending and delivering on mission. 

Grants must not be used to pay for services that the Foundation already pays for or has free access, such as GitHub, Zoom, Meetup, Streamyards, Azure, etc. Grants can be used to offset costs, such as paying for Azure or AWS instances, a dedicated Zoom room, or similar. This is to ensure that the Grant pool is not diminished by paying more for a service that might be free to the grantee, or at a vastly reduced rate, which will allow for even more grants and more funds for mission related activities OWASP doesn't currently do. 

## Financial Controls

### Restricted (Directed) Sponsorship of a grant

If a sponsor has a restricted donation directed to fund a specific grant, this is permitted. Normal sponsorship rules apply, such as minimum amounts, a limited number of restricted gifts per year, and admin fees to cover running costs of restricted gifts, and treatment of the donation once the grant outcome has been delivered. 

Grants should solicit unrestricted donations to avoid admin fees, tax and spending restrictions, and donor disappointment when we have to treat that restricted donation per IRS tax laws (essentially, restricted gifts become unrestricted after the financial year, which means the donor would have to make a restricted donation each year). 

The Foundation can provide financial transparency to all grant donors, restricted or not, so the usual reasons for a restricted gift (e.g. funds only spent on the grant) are not present. 

### Grant periods

Unless a large, multi-year grant is approved, grants are only applicable within the current financial year. If a grant is approved in December, only spending to December 31 that year can occur. A new grant proposal for the next financial year will need to be approved. This could be the same grant proposal, with slightly different budget deliverables or milestones as some work may have occured or been paid for.

### Unspent funds

Any funds not disbursed for a grant are returned to the Grant pool once a grant has delivered on its final milestone, or if the grant is terminated by the Grant Committee, or if the end of the financial year occurs. 

### Reasonable Person

Grants should be granted on the basis that a reasonable person can easily determine that the grant is on mission and will likely result in the grant's proposed outcome. If a grant proposal is contentious in the Committee, it's likely not to pass this test, and should be improved, refined, re-written, or rejected. 

### Capital Expenditure

If a grant proposal includes a capital expenditure of more than $1000, it should be carefully considered and rejected if not essential to the success of the grant. Capital expenditure of less than $1000 should be expensed and written off immediately, but in general such expenses are unlikely to be approved unless directly for the use of the project, chapter, or committee.  

Capital expenses of over $1000 must be tracked in the Foundation's asset register. All assets belong to the Foundation, they are not gifts. After writing off the capital expense per relevant tax law, the Grants Committee can choose to re-use, donate, or sell the asset as they see fit. If the asset is sold, the funds will be donated as an unrestricted gift to the Grants pool. 

### Quarterly Review of Operations

Within 30 days of the end of each financial quarter, the Grants Committee will review the Grants process and activities, and provide a report to the Board on the Grant Committee's activities, including funds spent, funds left, funds committed, number of grants awarded, and any delivered or successful outcomes. Lastly, the Committee can review and make  recommendations on improvements to the governance or running of the Grants Committee. 

### Audit

Once every three years, the Grants Committee shall be a part of the Foundation audit. The presence and effectiveness of financial controls and governance will be evaluated. The Board shall address any audit recommendations.
