## Overview

In the course of fulfilling the mission and business interests of the OWASP Foundation, members, staff, and partners will incur expenses that may be reimbursable. Generally, the policy of the Foundation is that all expenses should be "fair and reasonable" as measured by leadership, the community, and the standards for non-profit foundations. Expense categories are defined by the annual budget process and funds are approved and disbursed within those budgetary limits.

## Who can use this policy?

Leaders of Chapters, Project, and Committees. 

Events are funded under the Events policy. Events will use the same expense systems as this policy, but their budget is drawn from the relevant approved Event budget. 

Exceptions can be made on a case by case basis for OWASP Members. It is unlikely a non-member submitting an expense will have that expense paid. 

## Fair and Reasonable Expenses
Generally, the policy of the Foundation is that all expenses should be "fair and reasonable" as measured by leadership, the community, and the standards for non-profit foundations. Historical approval of expenses does not obligate the Foundation to approval like expenses in the future. 

Those items which are considered fair and reasonable include:
- Chapter Specific
  - Event Services, Catering, and Space for Chapter  Meetings
  - Only apply to the chapter's operating area
- Project Specific
  - Graphic Design
  - Technical Contractor
  - Software Licenses
- Applicable to Chapters, Projects and Committees
  - Annual Celebratory Leader Gatherings
  - Printing
  - Domain Names

Larger expense requests than the current expense cap should be submitted for pre-approval, or preferably made through the Grants process especially if the fair and reasonable test fails, but the idea is on mission. 

Preapproval of expenses under $250 is not required. 

Receipts are required for payment. 

The OWASP Foundation does not promote the consumption of alcohol and expects its staff, members, and partners to use good judgment when entertaining. Alcohol expenses are reimbursable when part of a food bill provided the alcohol costs are no more than 50% of the total expenses for that event.

### Prohibition of entering into contracts or periodic payments as expenses

Leaders and Members, under our signing policy, are not authorized OWASP signatories, and thus they are unable to enter into a contract or accept terms and conditions on OWASP's behalf. This includes subscription models or periodic payments plans. If you need to do this, please log a ticket with the Foundation, and we will review and enter into any such contract if necessary.

If the Foundation already runs a similar or the same service (such as Zoom, Azure, AWS, or StreamYards), or there is a day rate or single event fee at the same location, your request will be rejected.

### Events

Events are treated somewhat differently as they are likely to span over a multi-year period and have their own budget to draw from. The expenses are also likely to be much larger. This policy is to be used by Events for smaller purchases, such as paying for local signage or shipping fees, or similar, and not big ticket items such as hotel bookings.

The expense limit for events is per the approved budget for that Event. 

The "fair and reasonable" test applies to the approved budget. Event expenses in excess of - or not mentioned in - the relevant approved budget will not be approved. Board approval will be required to modify and approve a budget under these circumstances. 

Event funds will be drawn from the relevant approved event budget, and not the expense pool. 

Larger payments (those over $1k) should be invoiced or paid by the OWASP Foundation's Events team rather than the expense system. , again drawn or credited to the approved event budget. 

If in doubt, please consult the Events team. 

## COVID RESTRICTIONS

OWASP has a responsibility to provide its community and staff with a safe environment and to be financially responsible. Nearly all of our usual income sources have disappeared, so we need to curtail expenses. 

We all want to return to physical events as quickly and as safely as possible, but we have to ensure the safety of our community and staff before any social desires or OWASP's financial needs.

The following gathering, travel, and expense restrictions will apply until further notice, and reviewed regularly. 

### Maximum expense cap

During the COVID pandemic, a cap of $250 USD per request is in place for expenses. 

This is to preserve Foundation funds to ensure a post-COVID recovery is possible. 

### Use of OWASP provided virtual tools is mandated

Chapters, Projects, and Committees have free access to Foundation virtual tools, such as Zoom, Google Meet, YouTube, GitHub, and so on. Any expenses for these services will be rejected. 

This is to preserve Foundation funds to ensure a post-COVID recovery is possible. 

### Physical meetings during COVID require pre-approval

If you want to run or expense a physical gathering, please get pre-approval to demonstrate you are permitted to hold such an event by your local health authorities and any conditions that may apply. Only pre-approved physical gathering expenses will be paid. 

OWASP is not a health agency, and we are unlikely to be present in your local area. We require Chapters, Projects, and Committees to comply with their local COVID regulations, including any face covering mandates or regulations, prohibition of in-person gatherings, limits on event sizes, preferences for outdoor locations, adequate internal fresh air ventilation, access to sanitizer or hand washing facilities, and required social distancing. 

If there are no local regulations and local community transmission is still occurring, approval for physical gatherings will not be authorized. 

Where there are relaxed or post-COVID restrictions in place, you are required to adhere to them. Please use common sense to avoid spreading the virus further. In particular, OWASP strongly encourages the use of face coverings or masks, adequate social distancing such as spacing out seating, limits on attendee numbers, provide sanitizer and disposable face masks, encourages frequent hand washing, and a preference for outdoor locations. 

PPE such as disposable face masks, antiseptic sprays or wipes, and hand sanitizer are fair and reasonable expenses during COVID for pre-approved meetings.

### Periodic payments to event spaces and co-working prohibited

Some chapters have traditionally filed expenses for a physical location or similar. This could apply also to a physical shared workplace, such as WeWork, for chapters. 

Physical event space or co-working membership fees or subscriptions are not permitted during COVID, and all such expenses will be rejected. 

Once your local area re-opens and you have pre-approval to run a physical gathering, please pay per day or per event. Going forward, OWASP will only be paying for physical locations if a physical event or activity is actually held, and not on the off chance that you may or may not hold an event or visit a co-working space. 

As per our signing policy, Chapters, Projects, and Committees are not permitted to enter into contracts or sign on behalf of OWASP, so any contracts with a shared office or event space is not an official OWASP contract and will not be paid. 

### Unauthorized gatherings 

Unauthorized gatherings or expense requests for physical gatherings without prior approval will be rejected, and the leadership of the chapter, project, or committee refered to the Compliance Committee for disciplinary action, as unauthorized or unsafe physical gatherings creates health risks for the OWASP community, and legal and financial risk to the Foundation. 

If your country is open and community transmission free, such as New Zealand, the discipline component of this section will not apply. Unauthorized events will still have expenses rejected, however. 

### Travel prohibited

Travel expenses are not permitted at all during COVID restrictions, as travellers may get stuck in quarantine or stranded in another place away from home.

### Review of restrictions

These restrictions will be reviewed by the Foundation quarterly until they are removed. A recommendation to add, modify, or remove these restrictions will be made to the Board. 

## Reimbursement Process

Expenses, along with receipts for reimbursement, shall be submitted through the OWASP Foundation ticketing system for processing and payment. Please note ALL reimbursement request information, except payment instructions, will be shared publicly in various accounting reports and by submitting an expense reimbursment, you agree to that disclosure.

- Reimbursement requests must be submitted within 60 days of the expense.
- Requests must include itemized receipts, payment instructions, and supporting documentation.
- Wire transfer reimbursements are net banking fees.
- Reimbursements will be made within 30 days provided the information submitted is approved, complete, and accurate.
- Bundling complete trip expenses into one submission is preferred.
- When submitting expenses for travel, please subtotal amounts for Transit (Air/train/taxi), Lodging, and Meals.

Approvals for reimbursments shall follow the [Signatory Guidelines](/www-policy/operational/signatory) of the OWASP Foundation. Exception process for denied reimbursments shall be:
- Email with narrative and expense information sent to the Treasurer
- Proper compliance to policy and extenuating circumstances will be considered.
- In consultation with the Executive Director, Treasurer will make final determination

It is a very serious matter if you record false or misleading information on expense reimbursements. You may not request reimbursement for expenses that you did not have or that were not business-related.

## Travel Assistance Programs

From time to time, the OWASP Foundation will budget funds for Leaders and Members to travel while furthering the mission of the Foundation. All travel reimbursed through the Travel Assistance Program must be pre-approved. The Executive Director along with staff will define the requirements and limits, along with the process for participating in these programs.

## Hardware

Capital asset purchases for chapters and projects are strongly discouraged and if over $250 requires pre-approval by the Executive Director. Capital assets under $2,000 purchased by the Foundation will be expensed and not amortized, additionally capital assets under $1,000 are removed from Foundation inventory after 12 months of use.

## OWASP Project Contracting

All OWASP Projects are started with the understanding that they will be volunteer run, and they must remain volunteer run.

In the event that a Project's Leaders decide they would like to hire a contractor to work on a particular aspect of the project, for instance user interface design, then the Project Leaders must manage the recruitment, contracting, and payment on a task/work assignment basis. Contractors must be paid upon satisfactory completion of the task/work assignment and execute a completed [OWASP Foundation Consulting Agreement](/www-policy/legal/contractor-template).

**Failure to comply with any of the above policies may result in expenses, and in particular you reimbursement request, being denied.**
